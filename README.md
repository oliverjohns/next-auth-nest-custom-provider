# next-auth-nest-custom-provider

Nextjs with next-auth connect with custom OIDC provider running in NestJs

This is just a proof of concept of how to connect nextJs app with a OIDC provider in NestJS.

Many thanks to this [https://github.com/adrianbrs/nest-oidc-provider](https://github.com/adrianbrs/nest-oidc-provider) repo for providing the OIDC implementation in Nestjs.
